Struggling to keep up with customer demands? AI chatbots can help. But how do you create an AI chatbot that can truly be helpful for your business?

A customer visits your website with a burning question, but your live chat support team is swamped. They wait for a response, their frustration grows, and eventually, they abandon ship. In a time where immediacy and speed are vital for customer satisfaction, that kind of scenario is not good for your brand. This is where AI chatbots can be your saving grace. AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries 24/7, answer frequently asked questions, and even schedule appointments—all while freeing up your human support team for more complex issues.

But with an endless number of AI chatbot builder platforms available, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. Don’t panic, we’ve done the hard part and got you covered. We’ve tested several AI chatbot builder platforms, picked out their key features, and put together some of the five best AI chatbot builder platforms to help you create your own AI chatbot.

## What are AI Chatbot Builders?
AI chatbot builders come in various forms, but at their core, they are tools designed to create and deploy AI-powered conversational interfaces. Much like an engineer's workshop, these platforms serve as a developer's workbench for crafting intelligent virtual assistants.

You'll find two distinct types of chatbot builders: **no-code** and **code-based**. The no-code variety typically offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface, enabling users to construct and deploy chatbots without the need for extensive coding knowledge. On the other hand, code-based builders cater to more traditional software development approaches, allowing developers to build chatbots using APIs and programming functionalities.

While both options are viable, no-code builders are particularly well-suited for those with limited technical expertise or those who simply want to put a chatbot together as fast as possible while letting the chatbot builder platform do the heavy lifting.

Regardless of the type, the underlying principle remains the same – these platforms serve as gateways, facilitating seamless integration with the AI model of your choice. They provide a comprehensive suite of tools and features to help you design, train, and fine-tune your chatbots. That said, let’s get into what makes an AI chatbot builder an option worth considering.

## What to Look for in an AI Chatbot Builder
So, how do you find an AI chatbot builder that checks all the right boxes? And what are the boxes your AI chatbot builder needs to check? Here are some key features to consider:

- **Ease of Use**: A no-brainer. Look for a platform with a drag-and-drop interface or a platform you only need to click a few buttons to set up.
- **Integration Power**: Ensure the builder can be integrated with other relevant platforms and tools. Think integration with tools like your CRM, CMS, communication tools, and more.
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Go for platforms that let you deploy your bot across different platforms like websites, messaging apps, or social media.
- **Customization Options**: Go beyond basic templates. The builder should allow you to personalize your chatbot's look, feel, and conversational style to match your brand.
- **Top-Line AI Models**: The builder should leverage advanced AI models to ensure your chatbot delivers natural, engaging conversations with human-like understanding. Go for platforms that offer AI models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, and other models in their class.
- **Free Trials**: Free trials might seem like a trivial consideration, but they can save you from paying for the wrong platform. Go for platforms that offer free trials to enable you to test their capabilities, or better yet, a free plan.
