### What Is GPT-4o? Exploring Its Use Cases In a Business

**Publish Date:** May 23, 2024

In April, LMSYS’s Chatbot Arena saw “im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot” on its leaderboard for top generative AIs.

The same AI model has been revealed as GPT-4o. The “GPT2” in the name doesn’t indicate OpenAI’s previous AI model, “GPT-2.” Instead, it suggests a new architecture for the GPT models, with “2” indicating a major change in the model’s design.

OpenAI’s engineering teams consider it a significant change, justifying a new version number. However, marketing teams present it modestly as a continuation of GPT-4 rather than a complete overhaul.

Let’s explore what’s new in GPT-4o, what it offers, and how to use it in a business.

#### What Is GPT-4o?

GPT-4o is OpenAI’s latest flagship generative AI model. The “O” in GPT-4o stands for “Omni,” meaning “every” in Latin, highlighting the model’s enhanced capabilities to handle text, speech, and video.

This new model simplifies user interactions with AI, making it more accessible and much faster to respond compared to previous iterations of OpenAI’s generative AI models.

You can ask ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4o, questions and interrupt its answers. The model listens when interrupted and reframes responses in real-time based on the input. It can pick up nuances in a user’s voice and generate different emotive voice outputs, including singing.

OpenAI’s CTO explains, “GPT-4o reasons across voice, text, and vision. This is incredibly important because we’re looking at the future of interaction between humans and machines.”

#### What Does GPT-4o Offer?

Here are some of the prominent highlights of GPT-4o:

- **Improved user experience:** Interactions with AI have become more natural and easy.
- **Multilingual capabilities:** GPT-4o performs better in around 50 languages, making it more accessible globally.
- **Improved performance:** GPT-4o is approximately twice as fast as GPT-4 Turbo and costs half the price while offering higher rate limits.
- **Enhanced voice capabilities:** Though improved voice features aren’t available to all customers due to misuse risks, OpenAI supports a small group of trusted partners.
- **Availability of free tier:** GPT-4o is available in the free tier for ChatGPT. ChatGPT Plus subscribers have 5x higher messaging limits. If rate limits are hit in GPT-4o, the model switches to GPT-3.5 automatically.
- **Improved user experience:** OpenAI offers a more conversational home screen and message layout on the web. The desktop version of ChatGPT with GPT-4o for macOS (rolling out to ChatGPT Plus users in phases) lets users ask questions through a keyboard shortcut. The Windows version will come later this year.
- **Natural conversations:** The model handles interruptions while adjusting its response and tone accordingly. Conversations happen at a natural pace, with brief pauses as the model reasons through responses.

#### Risks and Concerns with GPT-4o

Generative AI policies in companies are still developing. The European Union Act is the only significant legal framework. Decisions on what constitutes safe AI are left to individual companies.

OpenAI uses a preparedness framework to decide if a model can be released to the public. It tests the model for cybersecurity, potential biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear threats, ability to persuade, and model autonomy. The model’s score is the highest grade (Low, Medium, High, or Critical) it receives in any category.

GPT-4o has a medium concern, avoiding the highest risk level that might upend human civilization.

Like all generative AIs, GPT-4o might not always behave exactly as intended. However, compared to previous models, GPT-4o shows significant improvements. It may present some risks, like deepfake scam calls. To mitigate these risks, audio output is only available in preset voices.

#### GPT-4o vs. Previous Generative AI Models from OpenAI

GPT-4o offers better image and text capabilities to analyze input content. Compared to previous models, GPT-4o excels at answering complex questions like, “What’s the brand of the T-shirt that a person is wearing?” For instance, this model can look at a menu in a different language and translate it.

Future models will offer much more advanced capabilities, such as watching a sports event and explaining its rules.

Here’s what has changed in GPT-4o compared to other generative AI models from OpenAI:

- **Tone of voice:** Previous OpenAI systems combined Whisper, GPT-4 Turbo, and Text-to-Speech in a pipeline with a reasoning engine, limiting their ability to express different emotions or styles of speech. With GPT-4o, a single model reasons across text and audio, making it more receptive to tone and audio information available in the background, generating higher-quality responses with different speaking styles.
- **Low latency:** GPT-4o’s average voice mode latency is 0.32 seconds. This is nine times faster than GPT-3.5's average of 2.8 seconds and 17 times faster than GPT-4's average of 5.4 seconds.
- **Better tokenization:** Tokens are units of text that a model can understand. When you work with a large language model (LLM), the prompt text is first converted into tokens. When you write in English, three words take close to four tokens. If it takes fewer tokens to represent a language, fewer calculations need to be made, and text generation speed increases. Moreover, this decreases the price for API users as open charges per token input or output are made.

In GPT-4o, Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Gujarati, among others, have benefited from reduced tokens. Arabic shows a 2x reduction, while East Asian languages observe a 1.4x to 1.7x reduction in tokens.

#### GPT-4o vs. Other Generative AI Models

GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini Pro 1.5 are the top contenders to compare with GPT-4o. Llama 3 400B may be a contender in the future, but it isn’t finished yet.

Below is a comparison of GPT-4o with the aforementioned models based on different parameters:

- **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU):** This test includes tasks on elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem-solving ability. GPT-4o performs better than other AI models.
- **Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA):** Multiple-choice questions are written by domain experts in biology, physics, and chemistry. The questions are high-quality and extremely difficult: experts who have or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 74% accuracy. GPT-4o delivers better performance than other models.
- **MATH:** Middle school and high school mathematics problems. The performance of GPT-4o was found to be better than that of other models.
- **HumanEval:** It tests the functional correctness of computer code used for checking code generation. GPT-4o’s performance was better than that of other models.
- **Multilingual Grade School Math (MSGM):** Grade school mathematics problems are translated into ten languages, including underrepresented languages like Bengali and Swahili. Claude 3 Opus performed better than GPT-4o in MSGM.
- **Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP):** Questions that require understanding complete paragraphs, such as adding, counting, or sorting values, spread across multiple sentences. GPT-4 Turbo performed better than GPT-4o in DROP.

Performance fluctuates only by a few percentage points when you compare GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o. However, these LLM benchmarks don’t compare AI’s performance on multi-modal problems. The concept is new, and ways of measuring a model’s ability to reason across text, audio, and video are yet to come.

GPT-4o’s performance is impressive and shows a promising future for multimodal training.

#### GPT-4o Use Cases

GPT-4o can reason across text, audio, and video effectively. It makes the model suitable for a variety of use cases, for example:

- **Real-time computer vision and natural interaction:** GPT-4o can now interact with you as you would converse with humans. You need to spend less time typing, making the conversation more natural. It delivers quick and accurate information.  

With more speed and audiovisual capabilities, OpenAI presents several real-time use cases where you can interact with AI using the view of the world. This opens up opportunities for navigation, translation, guided instructions, and comprehending complex visual information.

For example, GPT-4o can run on desktops, mobiles, and potentially wearables in the future. You can show a visual or desktop screen to ask questions rather than typing or switching between different models and screens.

On the other hand, GPT-4o's ability to understand video input from a camera and verbally describe the scene can be incredibly useful for visually impaired people. It would work like an audio description feature for real life, helping them understand their surroundings better.

- **Enterprise applications:** GPT-4o connects your device inputs seamlessly, making it easier to interact with the model. With integrated modalities and improved performance, enterprises can use it to build custom vision applications. 

You can use it where open-source models aren’t available

 and switch to custom models for additional steps to reduce costs.
